                The game "Guess the Number" is a popular guessing game where one player thinks of a
                number and the other player tries to guess it within a certain range. Here are the
                instructions for the game:
                <br> <br>
                The guesser continues to make guesses based on the feedback received, narrowing
                down the possible range of the secret number. The game continues until the guesser
                successfully guesses the secret number. The guesser wins the game when their guess
                matches the secret number chosen by the thinker.

                The computer selects a word from a predetermined list of words. The chosen word
                will be the one the player needs to guess.

                The game continues until the player successfully guesses the chosen word or decides
                to give up. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win the game. If the
                player gives up, the computer reveals the correct word.

                Both players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
                Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
                <br> <br>
                Compare the choices: If both players choose the same option, it's a tie. Otherwise, the player with the
                winning choice wins the round.
                Play multiple rounds to determine the overall winner.
